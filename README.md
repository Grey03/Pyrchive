# Requirements
customtkinter

pillow

# Adding Files
This software is quite simple. First click upload at the top of the screen.

Then fill out each space with the correct information.

## Important information on tagging
Tagging is handled via spaces, for example "cat dog lizard" is correct. Things suck as "cat, dog, lizard" will be wonky.
Do not put tags on new lines either. If you have a multi-word tag I recommend using underscores instead of spaces, example "I_love_coding ai_generation"

Once you have filled out all the fields (Including selection of file location)
Just save! You should see your file now in the browser.


# Searching
Searching is quite simple, just type out a tags like so "cat dog snake" and either press enter on the search bar or click the button
If you want, you can exclude tags in a search by adding a "-" in front of a tag : "cat dog -snake"
On the left you can see tags, clicking one of these tags will add it to the search ba.

# Saved Searches
You can save your favorite search bars! Just type all that you want for your search and click save on the left.
At the top of your screen there is a dropdown with all saved searches

# Tag groups
Say you have a few related, users can place them into "groups" for the simple feature of coloring the tags in the tag list.
This helps users easily spot tags that are related. You can create and manage them in the settings.
